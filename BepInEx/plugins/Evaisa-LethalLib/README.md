# Recent Changes 
  
- Potentially breaking changes! May need recompile in order for new features to work.
- "All" levels enum now includes modded maps.

- Added overflow for levelOverrides to Dungeon API, Enemies API, Items API, Map Objects API, and Weathers API
	- which can be used to add to specific levels by name rather than enum.
