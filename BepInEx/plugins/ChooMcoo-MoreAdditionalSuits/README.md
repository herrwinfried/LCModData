# More Additional Suits v1.0.2
## About
A modification of AdditionalSuits which adds 4 additional suits on top of the 8 from the original mod, filling the suit rack completely. Also tweaked a couple colors and cleaned up the texture work a bit.

All credit goes to the orignal mod author, [AlexCodesGames](https://twitter.com/AlexCodesGames). I simply tweaked and added more textures.

As I do not wish to simply copy their entire readme, if you want details regarding adding more suits and accessing the source code please go look at the orignal mod page here: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AlexCodesGames/AdditionalSuits/

As they update their mod I will update my version of it as well. I don't plan on doing anything further with this unless I decide to adjust any of the colors to my personal preference as this is mainly meant to be used among my friends.
