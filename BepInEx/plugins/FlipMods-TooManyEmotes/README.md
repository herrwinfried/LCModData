# TooManyEmotes

## There are never Too Many Emotes!
<strong>This mod adds a ton of new emotes to the game, which can be purchased in the store.</strong><br>
If you hate progression and just want to dance, you set all emotes to be unlocked in the config. All clients will sync to the server's settings.<br><br>
With this mod, you will be able to break dance over your teammates' corpses!<br>
Currently, there are There are currently over 100 emotes, and (likely) more on the way!<br>
These include common emotes, such as waving, taunting, crying, etc.<br>
Various dances are also included! You can see a preview of them in the gif down below!
<br>
<br>



## Over 100 Emotes!

- Though there are a lot of emotes, existing emotes will be continued to be polished in future updates when needed.<br>
- Emotes can be purchased in the terminal shop by typing "Emotes". You can read more about it below.
<br>
### Here's a preview of some emotes!

## Emote Menu

- Emote radial menu is included!
- By default, you can open the radial menu by pressing the backtick/tilde key. This can be changed in the config.
- Not shown in the gif below, but you can have multiple pages of emotes now! (1.3.5)

## Emote Store

- You can view the emote store in the terminal, either at the bottom of the "store" section, or by typing "emotes".
- Three emotes will be available at a time in the store, and rotate per-quota.
- The number of emotes in the rotation can be changed in the config.
- Each game, you will start off with 100 free emote credits.
- Type "Emotes" in the terminal to view all and future emote commands.
- Everyone will start off with a set of complementary emotes each game!
<br><br>

## Rarity System

- Emotes will be categorized into 4 tiers based on "rarity".
- This will affect the likelyhood of an emote for a given tier to appear in the emote store rotation.
- This will also affect their price.
- All emotes are color coded in the terminal!
- Colors are configurable in the accessibility section in the config.
- NOTE: This system can be ignored by setting the weights for each rarity tier to the same number in the config.
<br><br>

## Third Person Emotes

- To help prevent weird camera movements for certain emotes, and to help lower motion sickness, you will perform custom emotes in third-person.
- While emoting, you can freely move your camera without turning your character, or interrupting your emote.
- Upon moving, or canceling the emote, you will revert back to your normal view.
<br><br>

## Everyone is Synced

- When you buy an emote, everyone on the server unlocks the emote.
- When players join the server, already unlocked emotes will be synced with them.
- All unlocked emotes will be reset upon starting a new game, disconnecting, or will be synced with future servers you join.
- When performing a custom emote, all players will see the same emote.
<br><br>

## Emote Loadouts (New in 1.5.4)

- Emote loadouts are now included to the left of the radial menu.
- Currently, there are two loadouts. "Favorites" and "All".
- Favoriting emotes will persist throughout multiple sessions, or upon closing/relaunching the game.<br>
Favorited emotes will only be available if they have been unlocked in your session.
<br><br>

## Saved Progression

- All emotes are unlocked for each saved game.
- When you close your game, or stop the server, all unlocked emotes during that session will be saved.
- This means, you will reload your previously unlocked emotes upon loading an existing save, provided that they were already unlocked.
- Unlocked emotes will still reset upon restarting, or starting a new game.
<br><br>

## Integrates well with Unmodded Clients

- Playing custom emotes will just look like the regular Dance1 for other clients without the mod.
- This mod is designed to let you unlock emotes (or have them all unlocked by default) if the host does not have the mod.<br>
This will allow all clients to use emotes regardless of the mods the host is running.
<br><br>

## Current Configurable Settings

- All server related config settings will be synced between all clients.
- Starting the game with all emotes unlocked. This will opt you out of using the emote store.
- Emote price can be adjusted.
- Number of emotes per rotation can be adjusted.
- Number of free emote coupons per game can be adjusted.
<br><br>

## Future Plans

- Adding more emotes! More emotes are already on the way!
- Continue polishing existing emotes that need love!
- Adding random emote sales. This will be similar to the random sales for items in the store.
- Adding a "mystery" emote to each rotation. You won't know what it is until you purchase it!
<br><br>

- Compatible with More_Emotes!
- Compatible with MoreCompany Cosmetics!
- Third person camera mods may or may not play nice. Who knows?
